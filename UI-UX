ðŸš€ Excited to Share My First UI/UX Design Journey with IBM ðŸš€
Getting started with UI/UX design seemed daunting, but thanks to the comprehensive IBM online program, Iâ€™ve just completed my first ever design project using Figma! Hereâ€™s what went down:
ðŸŽ¨ Created a Sales App featuring three screens.
ðŸ’¡ Incorporated prototype interactions to simulate real-life usage.
ðŸ™Œ Experienced a huge learning curve but gained invaluable insights.
A heartfelt thank you to the amazing IBM team for making this experience enriching and enjoyable! This project has not only boosted my skills but also my confidence in digital design.
